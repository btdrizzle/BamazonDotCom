# BamazonDotCom Mock CLI Marketplace

This app runs in the command line and utilizes node.  There are two different views a user can experience, 
from the customer point of view and from the manager point of view.

## Features

This app is interactive, with the command line asking questions and the user answering.  
This app connects with a live local sql database and can perform all required queries to view, add, and modify product information.

## Functionality

A user types either "node bamazonCustomer" to view the customer portal or "node bamazonManager" to view the manager portal.  A SQL database matching the name used and with table formatting matching exactly to what I have used must be in place to use program.  To view functionality, look at screenshots in the 'screenshots' folder of this repo.
